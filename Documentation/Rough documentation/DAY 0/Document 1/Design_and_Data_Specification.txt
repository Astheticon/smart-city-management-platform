Smart City Management Platform
Design & Data Specification (Step 1 & Step 2)
1. Scope Overview

This project implements a prototype Smart City Management Platform focused on monitoring and analyzing selected urban parameters using simulated and prototype-level IoT data.

The system addresses the following urban challenges:

Traffic congestion monitoring

Environmental condition monitoring

Delayed response to abnormal urban conditions

The implementation emphasizes system integration, data analytics, and centralized monitoring, rather than full-scale real-world deployment.

2. System Scope and Features
2.1 Implemented Features

The platform includes the following features:

Simulated IoT data generation for traffic and environmental parameters

Optional hardware-based data acquisition using basic sensors

Real-time data ingestion through backend APIs

Traffic congestion prediction using analytical / machine learning models

Rule-based alert generation with priority classification

Web-based dashboard for visualization and monitoring

2.2 Out of Scope

The following are intentionally excluded:

City-wide hardware deployment

Advanced deep learning models

Real-time emergency dispatch systems

Full-scale cloud production infrastructure

3. Data Sources

The system supports two types of data sources:

Simulated IoT data generated using software scripts

Prototype hardware data collected using basic sensors (AQI, temperature, humidity)

Both data sources use the same data format, ensuring consistency and scalability.

4. Sensor Data JSON Format

All sensor data sent to the backend follows the structure below:

{
  "source": "simulator | hardware",
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS",
  "traffic": {
    "vehicle_count": 120,
    "traffic_density": 78
  },
  "environment": {
    "aqi": 165,
    "temperature": 32.5,
    "humidity": 58
  }
}

Design Note

Sensor data represents raw observations only.
No alert priority or intelligence is embedded at the sensor level.

5. Units and Valid Ranges
Traffic Parameters

Vehicle count: 0 – 200

Traffic density: 0 – 100 (%)

Environmental Parameters

Air Quality Index (AQI): 0 – 600+

Temperature: 0 – 60 °C

Humidity: 0 – 100 %

6. AQI Classification Levels

Air Quality Index values are interpreted using the following categories:

AQI ≤ 75 → Normal

75 < AQI ≤ 150 → Moderate

150 < AQI ≤ 250 → Poor

250 < AQI ≤ 400 → Very Poor

400 < AQI ≤ 600 → Severe

AQI > 600 → Hazardous

These categories provide finer-grained environmental awareness while enabling selective alert generation.

7. Alert Thresholds
7.1 Traffic Alerts

Traffic density ≥ 70 → High Congestion

Traffic density ≥ 85 → Critical Congestion

7.2 Air Quality Alerts

AQI > 150 → Air Quality Alert

AQI > 400 → Severe Air Quality Alert

7.3 Temperature Alerts

Temperature > 40 °C → Heat Warning

7.4 Humidity Alerts

Humidity < 30 % → Low Humidity Alert

Humidity > 70 % → High Humidity (Informational)

8. Alert Priority Classification

Alerts are classified based on urgency:

High Priority Alerts

Traffic congestion alerts

Air quality alerts

Temperature heat warnings

Low Priority Alerts

Humidity-related alerts

This prioritization helps prevent alert overload and supports effective decision-making.

9. Alert Data Structure (Derived Data)

Alerts are generated by the backend and stored separately from sensor data.

{
  "alert_type": "AQI | TRAFFIC | TEMPERATURE | HUMIDITY",
  "priority": "HIGH | LOW",
  "message": "Alert description",
  "value": 180,
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS"
}

10. Prediction Output Format

The traffic congestion prediction module outputs a categorical result:

{
  "predicted_congestion_level": "LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH"
}


This output is used for visualization and decision support.

11. Design Principles

Sensor data acquisition and system intelligence are decoupled

Alert logic and priorities are derived at the backend

The architecture is scalable, allowing real sensors to replace simulated inputs without modifying core logic

Hardware integration is implemented at a prototype level

12. Design Freeze Declaration

All data formats, thresholds, alert priorities, and design decisions described in this document are frozen and will not be modified during implementation.
